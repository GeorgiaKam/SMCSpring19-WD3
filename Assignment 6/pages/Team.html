                    In the early 1970’s, Dr.Cornell was a community activist who believed that
                empowered people could change the world for the better. Her mission was to 
                promote the knowledge of Traditional Herbal Medicine,while creating fair and 
                equitable trading relationships with the mostly impoverished people around the
                globe who collect and grow medicinal plants For the past four decades,Carl has
                 guided Traditional Medicinals through a time of incredible change, leading people 
                 to a newfound respect for herbalism.

                    Carter is our first non-founder CEO, 
                    which means she’s had some big shoes to fill. She took the 
                    reins from co-founder Drake Sadler in 2008, feeling called to
                     apply his business talents to products she deeply believes in.
                     A former CPA with Ernst & Young, Carter received her MBA from
                     The University of Chicago in marketing, and worked 
                     as a brand manager at Nestle Foods. In 1995, she took a 70% pay 
                     cut and a huge risk that would become the best decision of her 
                     career—left her business development position for 
                      natural food company.
